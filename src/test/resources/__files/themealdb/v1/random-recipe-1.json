      "strInstructions": "Dust the meat with flour to lightly coat.\r\nHeat enough vegetable oil in a large saucepan to fill the base, and fry the onion and meat until lightly browned. Season with salt and pepper.\r\nAdd the carrots, stock and more seasoning to taste.\r\nBring to the boil, cover and reduce the heat to a simmer. Simmer for at least an hour or until the meat is tender. Take your time cooking the meat, the longer you leave it to cook, the better the flavour will be.\r\nPreheat the oven to 180C\/350F\/Gas 4.\r\nAdd the drained potato cubes to the lamb.\r\nTurn the mixture into a pie dish or casserole and cover with the shortcrust pastry. Make three slits in the top of the pastry to release any steam while cooking.\r\nBrush with beaten egg and bake for about 40 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown.\r\nServe.",
